              Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more
              players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the
              other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain
              number of guesses.

              Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two
              people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three
              shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a
              closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with
              the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).{' '}
