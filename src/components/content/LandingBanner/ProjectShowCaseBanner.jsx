              The app aims to solve the problem of the user who wants to find a
              circular route for outdoor activities (walking, cycling, hiking).
              The user can view the map and search for routes without logging
              in, either circular routes or routes between a start and end
              point. Different activity types can be selected, and the result
              can be randomized. Once the user is logged in, favorite routes can
              be saved in My Routes and can be viewed on the map, or they can be
              removed from the list.

              We have a request from a client to write the software to control
              the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off
              provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy,
              in which case no planes can land or take off. Here are the user
              stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:
            </p>
            <p className="align-left">User Stories:</p>
            <p>
              As an air traffic controller, So I can get passengers to a
              destination, I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport
            </p>

              As an air traffic controller, So I can get passengers on the way
              to their destination, I want to instruct a plane to take off from
              an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport
            </p>
            <p>
              As the system designer So that the software can be used for many
              different airports I would like a default airport capacity that
              can be overridden as appropriate
            </p>

              Task is to test drive the creation of a set of classes/modules to
              satisfy all the user stories. Need to use a random number
              generator to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare
              occasions it may be stormy). In tests, I use a stub to override
              random weather to ensure consistent test behavior.
