              The app aims to solve the problem of the user who wants to find a
              circular route for outdoor activities (walking, cycling, hiking).
              The user can view the map and search for routes without logging
              in, either circular routes or routes between a start and end
              point. Different activity types can be selected, and the result
              can be randomized. Once the user is logged in, favorite routes can
              be saved in My Routes and can be viewed on the map, or they can be
              removed from the list.
