            The app aims to solve the problem of the user who wants to find a
            circular route for outdoor activities (walking, cycling, hiking).
            The user can view the map and search for routes without logging in,
            either circular routes or routes between a start and end point.
            Different activity types can be selected, and the result can be
            randomized. Once the user is logged in, favorite routes can be saved
            in My Routes and can be viewed on the map, or they can be removed

            Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn
            with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly
            innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.
            Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they
            approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates
            our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named
            Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the
            new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new
            category of items. First an introduction to our system:
          </div>
          <ul style={styles.text}>
            <li>
              All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we
              have to sell the item
            </li>
            <li>
              All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item
              is
            </li>
            <li>
              At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every
              item
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
            </li>
            <li>The Quality of an item is never negative</li>
            <li>"Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets</li>
            <li>The Quality of an item is never more than 50</li>
            <li>
              "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or
              decreases in Quality
            </li>
            <li>
              "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as it's
              SellIn value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10
              days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality
              drops to 0 after the concert
            </li>
            <li>
              "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
            </li>
